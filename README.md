# Cat-Vs-Dog-Classification

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using a labeled dataset containing images of cats and dogs, enabling it to accurately distinguish between the two classes.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Loading and preprocessing images for optimal model performance.
Model Architecture: A deep CNN designed for image classification.
Training: Model training using a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance on a test dataset.
